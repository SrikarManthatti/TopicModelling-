# TopicModelling-
Here I am performing LDA on the set of topics that are covered in the news sites. I will be using genism library for LDA model generation and create an interactive visualization to get the idea of what latent topics are covered in the news site with the help of their respective keywords.


Please see the TopicModelling.ipynb for the topic modelling on the news text that has been published on Australian news websites.
In the attached screenshot you can see the created visualization by using the genism model for various topics.

Required packages:
1. nltk
2. pandas
3. numpy
4. genism
5. sklearn
6. matplotlib
